    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>I am a B.Tech CSE student studying in a college located on the planet Earth. 
        I haven't done any big project as you can see I am just a beginner.
        So, please go easy on me this time. 
        I am a first year and would be graduating from college in 2028. 
        For now, I am trying to learn as much as I can. 
        Stay tuned for better projects :)</p>
